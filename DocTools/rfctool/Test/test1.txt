1. Introduction

   This document describes the cryptographic algorithm suites used in
   the Mesh and the implementation of Multi-Party Encryption and Multi-
   Party Key Generation used in the Mesh.

2. Multi-Party Cryptography

   The multi-party key generation and multi-party decryption mechanisms
   used in the Mesh protocols are made possible by the fact that Diffie
   Hellman key agreement and elliptic curve variants thereof support
   properties we call the Key Combination Law and the Result Combination
   Law.

   Let {X, x}, {Y, y}, {E, e} be {public, private} key pairs.

   The Key Combination law states that we can define an operator ? such
   that there is a keypair {Z, z} such that:

   Z = X ? Y and z = (x + y) mod o (where o is the order of the group)

   The Result Combination Law states that we can define an operator ?
   such that:

   (x ? E) ? (y ? E) = (z ? E) = (e ? Z).

2.1. Application to Diffie Hellman (not normative)

   For the Diffie Hellman system in a modular field p, o = p-1 and a ? b
   = a ? b = a.b mod p.

   Proof:

   By definition, X = e^x mod p, Y = e^y mod p, and Z = e^z mod p.

   Therefore,

   Z = e^z mod p = e^x+y mod p = (e^xe^y) mod p = e^x mod p.e^y mod p =
   X.Y

   A similar proof may be constructed for the operator ?.
