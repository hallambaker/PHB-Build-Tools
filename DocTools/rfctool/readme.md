# PHB Build Tools: RFC Tool

The RFC Tool converts specifications written in HTML, Markdown, XML or
Microsoft Word to the formats required by Internet standards organizations.

Currently, the only format supported is the IETF RFC format but support
for W3C and OASIS formats would only require an appropriate output
module to be written.
