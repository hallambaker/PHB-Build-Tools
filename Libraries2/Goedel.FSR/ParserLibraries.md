The parser libraries provide a means of serializing and deserializing data to
and from ASN.1, JSON or TLS schema formats and encoding and decoding XML, HTML and
Markdown texts. 

At present the data encoding libraries use an assortment of schema definition
languages. It is hoped that at some point it will be possible to use a single
schema language to serve all the formats.

The document handling libraries convert all input text to a stripped form which
corresponds loosely to HTML/2.0 or Markdown.
