The PHB Build Tool Libraries include libraries that are specific to the PHB Build tools
and libraries that have more general applicability.

Both sets of libraries apply a consistent set of coding standards where this is machine
checkable.

The libraries themselves are built using the PHB Build Tools. These may be used as
shell commands with a command line interface or as VSIX plug-ins integrated into the
Visual Studio shell.
