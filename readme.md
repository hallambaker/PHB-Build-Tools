# PHB Build Tools

## Info

PHB Build Tools is a set of domain specific languages that automate many common 
coding tasks including:

* Parsing command line options

* Building portable graphical User Interfaces

* Encoding and decoding ASN.1, JSON and other serializaation formats

* Documenting code

* Writing domain specific languages.

All the tools in PHB build tools are written using the Goedel code synthesis tool
which is in turn written in Goedel.

## The Tools

Each of the tools is documented individually. The current set of tools is:

ASN

Command

DNS

[RFCTool](DocTools/rfctool)

Domainer

Exceptional

FSRGen

Goedel3

GScript

MakeyMakey

Protogen


## Platforms

All the tools are written in C# and will run on any platform supported by 
.NET Core (i.e. Windows, OSX and Linux).

All the tools may be used in standalone mode from the console.

The tools did run in Visual Studio until some recent changes broke them. This is
being fixed.
