      <p id="s-abstract-1">The importance of naming in information systems is explained with reference to a typical use case. Existing Internet naming systems attempt to strike a balance between usability and machine readability. An alternative approach in which separate classes of identifiers are introduced for human and machine interaction is described. Human Interaction Identifiers are interpreted in the context in which they are used and are thus more compact and offer a superior user experience. Strong Internet Names are a form of Machine Interaction Identifier that are backwards compatible with existing Internet names that include a DNS address and are cryptographically bound to a security policy governing interpretation. The application of these approaches in the Mathematical Mesh is described.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-abstract-1">&para;</a></p>

      </h3>
      <p id="s-1-1">Hollywood Alice arrives at the airport. Her hire car is already waiting for her at the curb, every aspect of its function precisely matched to her preferences. The radio is tuned to her favorite station, the seats, mirrors and driving controls adapt to her measurements and of course, the navigation system is already programed with her itinerary.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-2">On the way to her destination, Hollywood Alice places a conference call to Bob and Carol by speaking their name. Bob wants to know if Alice’s new camera arrived in time for her trip. It did, but only just. Alice had only a few minutes to unwrap it and pack it for her trip. Carol has been to the area before and tells Alice she must see the Golden Gate bridge from Baker Beach, the same spot that Ansel Adams took his famous landscapes before and after the bridge was built. The navigator updates its route accordingly and Alice arrives in the golden hour. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-3">Her camera is a large modern DSLR but it doesn’t have a GPS, it doesn’t need one as it automatically captures this data from her mobile phone via Bluetooth. Alice joins the camera to the conference and it uses the same connection to upload thumbnails of her pictures for Bob and Carol. When she gets to her hotel room, the camera will upload the raw files to Alice’s personal cloud using the high-speed connection.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-3">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-4">It all works so much better in Hollywood.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-4">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-5">An extremely wealthy real-world Alice being followed by a minibus containing a road crew of a half dozen IT support staff might possibly be able to create a similar user experience today but even that is doubtful. Instead of taking pictures of the Golden Gate bridge at sunset, Real-world Alice is far more likely to find herself at the side of the road debugging Perl scripts or more likely, turning all the ‘labor-saving’ technology off because it simply isn’t worth the hassle. We have all the parts but they just don’t fit together properly and even when they appear to be joined, they often come apart. A ‘seamless user experience’ that isn’t actually seamless makes things worse, not better.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-5">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-6">There are many reasons that the scenario described above remains a pipe dream, not least the commercial interests of the technology providers. But one of the biggest obstacles to providing the seamless integration experienced by Hollywood Alice is the lack of a secure naming infrastructure. Providing Alice with a seamless user experience required seven data exchanges and ten trust relationships. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-6">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-1-8">The only infrastructures currently capable of managing those trust relationships would require Alice to be in constant communication with some form of ‘identity provider’ and to surrender a large part of her personal control to that infrastructure. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-8">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-9">There are proprietary infrastructures that provide an approximation of the user experience if Alice buys all her devices from the same vendor. But these require Alice to surrender even more personal control and in any case, there is no single company that makes phones, DSLR cameras and rents cars. And even if such a company existed, Alice would not be able to achieve seamless connectivity to Bob and Carol unless they live in the same walled garden as Alice.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-9">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-10">This document explores the problem of secure naming and describes the approach to naming taken in the Mathematical Mesh, a Personal Public Key Infrastructure (PPKI) that is designed to make computers easier to use by making them more secure.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-10">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1-11">The central idea is this: Current Internet identifiers are designed to provide a balance between human and machine use. Separating the functions allows a vastly more satisfactory user experience, in most cases the name of the intended referent being implicit from the context in which it is used. The key to making this approach practical being the introduction of a new form of <i>very</i> explicit identifier which is cryptographically bound to the context in which it is interpreted but is nevertheless backwards compatible with existing Internet identifiers through the use of DNS prefixing.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-11">&para;</a></p>

        <a class="selfRef" href="#n-identifiers-and-naming">Identifiers and Naming</a>
      </h4>
      <p id="s-1_1-1">In the field of semiotics, a <i>name</i> is a <i>symbol</i> whose meaning is purely conventional, that is the meaning of the name is based on nothing more than a common agreement to interpret it in a specific way. Most network identifiers are based on a name of some sort whether they be <code>example.com</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The proper functioning of the Internet depends on all the participants agreeing on a common interpretation of these identifiers which in turn gives rise for the need for naming authorities.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-2">Since a name is merely the result of an agreement, any naming scheme must be governed by an authority, even if that authority is just the one person who uses the names. The question of authority is thus an inescapable one when considering the security properties of naming schemes. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-3">One of the core technologies that made the World Wide Web possible was the realization that the means to resolve any network resource may be specified by means of a triple, {<i>what</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>how</i>}. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) <a class="xref" href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> is simply a syntax for expressing this triple in a single identifier: <i>how</i>://<i>where</i>/<i>what</i>. It seems intuitively obvious that whether these are expressed as one single unit or three ‘should’ make no difference. But the lightning success of the World Wide Web proves that combining all the information necessary into a single identifier makes all the difference in the world.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-3">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-4">While a URL contains a name component, it is not a pure name: The interpretation of the <i>where</i> component is intersubjectively determined by the choice of ICANN as the ultimate DNS naming authority, the interpretation of what and how is determined by the protocol specifications. Different users attempting to resolve http://example.com/ in different parts of the world may not receive back the same exact sequence of bytes but provided they are connected to ‘the Internet’ they should receive back a representation of the same ‘network resource’. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-4">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-5">Interpretation of the other type of Internet identifier users commonly encounter, the email address, is not so straightforward. Unlike a URL, the RFC822 email address does not contain a <i>how</i> component. It is implicit that alice@example.com is an SMTP email address, but this is only one of many ways in which it may be used today:<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-5">&para;</a></p>
      <ul id="s-1_1-6-">
        <li id="s-1_1-6">Send SMTP email<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-6">&para;</a></li>
        <li id="s-1_1-7">Initiate an XMPP chat<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-7">&para;</a></li>
        <li id="s-1_1-8">Web site username<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-8">&para;</a></li>
        <li id="s-1_1-9">Initiate a proprietary chat<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-9">&para;</a></li>
        <li id="s-1_1-10">Comment on a Web forum <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-10">&para;</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p id="s-1_1-11">From the user’s perspective, it is natural to assume that the address alice@example.com is held by the same individual in each of these contexts. But like many aspects of the Internet today, it is a mistaken assumption. The holder of the email address may or may not be the same as the person who responds when a chat session is initiated. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-11">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-12">An RFC822 email address is a combination of two names issued by separate authorities <i>who</i>@<i>where</i>. Since the <i>where</i> component is a DNS name, there is a certain degree of consistency in interpretation through the infrastructure managed by ICANN. No such guarantees are provided for the interpretation of <i>who</i>. A site may have a policy preventing reissue of account names to new users or it may not.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-12">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-13">The use of email addresses as identifiers on third party sites introduces a third authority. For example, Alice may use her email address alice@example.com as her account identifier for the chat service provided by example.net. Resolution of the name example.com is now controlled by the unseen third authority example.net but only within the context of the example.net chat application.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-13">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-14">While these concerns may appear abstract, the security consequences are anything but. It is the fact that alice@example.com could be the same person or different people that makes the Hollywood Alice experience unreachable today. Alice’s phone can’t integrate with her hire car or her camera or her cloud communications provider because they lack a common language for securely identifying themselves as belonging to Alice.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-14">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-1_1-15">The identifiers we use in the Internet today represent a compromise between expressiveness and usability. The more information we attempt to pack into an identifier, the more a user must remember or type or read. If we are to introduce a cryptographically secure identifier it must therefore be a subclass of identifier, an identifier which is usually if not always hidden ‘under the covers’ and is separate from the names that the user sees and interacts with. This is the purpose that the Mathematical Mesh PPKI serves.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1_1-15">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-2-1">The Mathematical Mesh <a class="xref" href="#draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture">[draft-hallambaker-mesh-architecture]</a> is a PPKI that manages two types of identifies: Human-Interaction identifiers which are primarily designed to support human interaction and Machine- Interaction identifiers which are primarily designed to support interactions between machines.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2-2">As we saw in the previous section, these categories are not necessarily exclusive. Most of Internet names used on the Internet today were designed to provide a compromise between human and machine interactions. Such a compromise is not practical in a cryptographic infrastructure such as the Mesh since there is really no way to make an identifier that presents a cryptographic work factor of 2<sup>118</sup> or better human friendly except by mapping it to another identifier designed for human use.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2-3">This section first describes the two types of identifier used in the Mesh and how one may be mapped to the other. The following sections describe the implementation of these ideas in the current implementation of the Mesh.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2-3">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-2_1-1">Human Interaction identifiers come in many different forms and a given user may use multiple identifiers to refer to the same entity in different contexts. Three different uses are distinguished:<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-1">&para;</a></p>

      </dl>
      <p id="s-2_1-8">Depending on the circumstances in which the identifiers are used, it is generally desirable that input identifiers be as compact as possible while output identifiers may provide more information. If Bob receives the conference request from Carol on his smartphone it is probably desirable for the display to present both the shortcut identifier from his personal contact directory ‘Alice’ and her full personal name ‘Alice Cryptographer’.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-8">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1-9">While most identifier forms used for input (text, voice) may also be used for output, the reverse is not true. A validated image of a subject’s trademark, as supported by the PKIX logotype extension <a class="xref" href="#RFC3709">[RFC3709]</a> provides a powerful means of telling a user which party operates the site they are visiting but would be highly impractical as an input format.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-9">&para;</a></p>

      </dl>
      <p id="s-2_1-17">For most human interactions, it is desirable to use the shortest identifier possible for input that does not lead to ambiguity. Thus, the use of contextual identifiers is generally preferred over global identifiers and the use of implicit identifiers is almost always best.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-17">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1-18">Most of the identifiers used in the ‘Hollywood Alice’ scenario were implicit identifiers. The devices Alice used understood the target of the commands she gave by the context in which she used them. As will be seen, the introduction of Strong Internet Names at the machine level allows them to be eliminated at the human level.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-18">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1-19">The only contextual identifiers that Alice used were ‘Bob’ and ‘Carol’ which were names from Alice’s personal contacts directory. There are many Bobs in the world but only one ‘Bob’ in Alice’s contact book.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-19">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1-20">The Hollywood Alice scenario only involved three people and a set of devices owned or rented by Alice. There was no need for global identifiers because the scenario did not require Alice to interact with the wider world. But it is the ability to communicate and interact on a global scale that gives the Internet its full power. It is the ability to establish secure communication with practically anyone in the world that makes the Internet the primary engine of international commerce. It is also the capability that gives rise to most Internet security concerns.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1-20">&para;</a></p>

      </h5>
      <p id="s-2_1_1-1">One of the chief differences between human interaction identifiers and machine interaction identifiers is that humans interact with certain expectations that may or may not be met. It is the manipulation of the user’s expectations that enables many types of phishing fraud.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1_1-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1_1-2">If a user sees a message that appears to come from a financial institution that they have a business relationship with and that expectation is not met, the result is likely to be some form of fraud on the user. Such failures are always and only the fault of the designers of the communications infrastructure. The user is never negligent, the user is never at fault if their action is the result of a good faith expectation of a different result.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1_1-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1_1-3">When the Internet was new, it was often viewed as creating a reality that was distinct and different from the ‘real’ offline world. While this point of view is still a common position among Internet protocol designers, it is no longer the case for an increasing proportion of users. The Internet existed before they did, they have been using the Internet since before they could talk. For the Internet generation, there is no online world, only <i>the</i> world.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1_1-3">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_1_1-4">It is the fact that human interaction identifiers are bound to expectations that give rise to security concerns in defining the mapping from human interaction identifiers to machine. If we are to avoid the need to deal with expectations in the interpretation of Machine Interaction Identifiers, we must use cryptography.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_1_1-4">&para;</a></p>

      </h4>
      <p id="s-2_2-1">Traditional Internet names are designed to achieve a balance between human and machine interaction. As a result, these identifiers omit much of the context that we require at the machine level to avoid the need to address the issue of expectations.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_2-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_2-2">For example, the identifier https://example.com/ specifies a resource that is to be retrieved by means of a TLS secured conversation but not the trust context in which the communication is to be established. While this is an acceptable, and in many cases an unavoidable situation for a human interaction identifier, it is a circumstance that is often unacceptable in the Internet of Things.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_2-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_2-3">Take for example, a high-risk process control application such as the placement of control rods in a nuclear reactor. A control loop critical to plant safety is governed by means of a three-term (PID) controller connected to a temperature sensor, an actuator and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. We would wish for it to be possible for all these communications to be secured cryptographically but we are required by regulation to account for the correct operation of any infrastructure on which we rely. The introduction of any Trusted Third Party role whether that be a WebPKI CA or a ICANN managing the DNSSEC, is going to be unacceptable.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_2-3">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_2-4">The Mathematical Mesh introduces a new form of name, the Strong Internet Name (SIN). A SIN is a name that is cryptographically bound to a security policy government the interpretation of the name. The use of a SIN is thus bound to a specific trust context.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_2-4">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_2-5">The use of SINs in Mesh enabled applications closely resembles the use of DNS names and IP addresses at the network level. In normal circumstances, the user only interacts with DNS names which are a name designed for human interaction. But the Internet core has no understanding or knowledge of DNS names. The only identifiers understood at the narrow waist are IP Addresses and so we must translate the DNS names to IP addresses to establish Internet communications.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_2-5">&para;</a></p>

      </h4>
      <p id="s-2_3-1">To make use of a Human Interaction Identifier, it must be first mapped to Machine Interaction identifier. We consider this mapping to be secure if and only if this translation meets the good-faith expectations of the user. If a user encounters a Human Interaction identifier that leads the user to reasonably expect that they will be interacting with their bank, this expectation must be met or a serious security vulnerability is created. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_3-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_3-2">The terms ‘reasonable expectation’ and ‘good-faith’ are of course subjective but not entirely without meaning. The various financial institutions that support the use of non-cash payments in the US operate under rules that absolve the user from blame or loss in almost any circumstance but nevertheless manage to profitably transfer an average of over $500 billion every day <a class="xref" href="#FedRes2016">[FedRes2016]</a>.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_3-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_3-3">The Mesh does not impose a model for mapping human to machine interaction identifiers but it does allow the user to put that mapping under their personal control. Devices connected to a Mesh Personal Profile share the same view of the world; the same set of bookmarks and contacts for defining personal names and the same set of trust roots for Certification Authorities trusted to provide brokered trust.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_3-3">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-2_3-4">In the existing model, mapping of the address https://example.com/ to a secure TLS endpoint takes place in two stages. First the DNS infrastructure is used to resolve the address example.com to an IP address. Next, the client begins making a connection to the host at the specified IP address, receives and validates a PKIX trust chain to a recognized authority and if satisfactory, declares the TLS connection trusted:<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_3-4">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-2_3-7">One of the biggest problems with the traditional approach is that TLS is only used to authenticate the server to the client.

      <p id="s-2_3-8">Consider the role of the camera in the Hollywood Alice scenario. Alice uses the camera to take pictures but this is only one of four interactions involving the camera.

      <p id="s-2_3-14">When Alice opens an account with a new financial institution, she adds them to her personal contact directory and (optionally) gives them a shortcut name. In the process, she reviews the credentials presented by the bank, a WebPKI Extended Validation certificate with a logotype extension presenting the Bank trademark. From the point at which the financial institution is added to Alice’s personal contact directory, the role of the Trust Authority is limited to revoking the trust relationship should the need arise. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-2_3-14">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-3_4-1">The UDF format used to construct SINs is calculated over both the content data and the IANA content type.

A security policy specification may be explicit or implicit. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-3_4-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-3_4-2">If a security policy is a PKIX Certificate Signing Certificate or End-Entity Certificate, the use of a security protocol consistent with the certificate attributes and protocol is required.

      <p id="s-3_4-3">Implicit security policy is convenient but blunt tool. We can establish a baseline for security in the case that an email address SIN authenticates a PKIX end-entity certificate with the dataEncipherment key usage set (i.e. use of S/MIME encryption is required). But once that baseline security is defined, we can only improve on it by decorating the certificate with additional extensions to specify security policy. This approach is unlikely to be satisfactory in the long term.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-3_4-3">&para;</a></p>

At the simplest level, the Mesh is simply a tool that allows a user to bind all their disparate electronic devices into one logical unit by means of cryptographic credentials that are in normal circumstances hidden from the user’s view.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-4-1">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-4-2">To begin using the Mesh, Alice first creates a personal profile and registers it to a CryptoMesh portal. Alice’s personal profile contains a master profile containing a set of administrative keys that are used to sign updates to the personal profile and master signature key that is used to sign the master profile itself. The fingerprint of the master signature key is the user’s personal mesh fingerprint.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-4-2">&para;</a></p>

      <p id="s-4-5">The Cryptomesh is envisaged as an open co-operative infrastructure for management of public Mesh profiles.

      <p id="s-4-6">Use of the CryptoMesh provides the typical user with all the advantages of a cloud service without the usual disadvantage of being tied to a single cloud provider.

All the information that is stored in the CryptoMesh is also stored on the user’s personal devices. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-4-6">&para;</a></p>

Any party that proposes to act as an authority in any form of naming scheme must accept that they are accountable to the community they serve. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-6_3-2">&para;</a></p>
      <p id="s-6_3-3">The approach described in this paper does not eliminate the authority problem but does allow it to be confined to the problem of mapping human interaction identifiers to other forms of identifier. Secure Internet Names are identifiers that are bound to a specific security policy governing their interpretation, allowing the role of any authority to be absolutely circumscribed.<a class="pilcrow" href="#s-6_3-3">&para;</a></p>
