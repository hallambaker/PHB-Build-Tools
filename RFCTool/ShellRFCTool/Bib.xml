<abstract><t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.

<abstract><t>This paper extends Shanon's concept of a 'work factor' to provide an objective measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or infrastructure design. Considering the hypothetical work factor based on an informed estimate of the probable capabilities of an attacker with unknown resources provides a better indication of the relative strength of protocol designs than the computational work factor of the best known attack.  The social work factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a credential issued in a PKI based on the cost of having obtained the credential through fraud at a certain point in time. Use of the social work factor allows evaluation of Certificate Authority based trust models, peer to peer (Web of Trust) models to be evaluated in the same framework. The analysis shows that each model has clear benefits over the other for some classes of user but most classes of user are served better by a combination of both.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This paper extends Shanon's concept of a 'work factor' to provide an objective measure of the practical security offered by a protocol or infrastructure design. Considering the hypothetical work factor based on an informed estimate of the probable capabilities of an attacker with unknown resources provides a better indication of the relative strength of protocol designs than the computational work factor of the best known attack.  The social work factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a credential issued in a PKI based on the cost of having obtained the credential through fraud at a certain point in time. Use of the social work factor allows evaluation of Certificate Authority based trust models, peer to peer (Web of Trust) models to be evaluated in the same framework. The analysis shows that each model has clear benefits over the other for some classes of user but most classes of user are served better by a combination of both.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs.  Cryptographic digests provide a means of uniquely identifying static data without the need for a registration authority.  A fingerprint is a form of presenting a cryptographic digest that makes it suitable for use in applications where human readability is required.  The UDF fingerprint format improves over existing formats through the introduction of a compact algorithm identifier affording an intentionally limited choice of digest algorithm and the inclusion of an IANA registered MIME Content-Type identifier within the scope of the digest input to allow the use of a single fingerprint format in multiple application domains.  Alternative means of rendering fingerprint values are considered including machine-readable codes, word and image lists.</t></abstract>
