<abstract>
<t>Three binary encodings for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are presented. JSON-B (Binary) is a strict superset of the JSON encoding that permits efficient binary encoding of intrinsic JavaScript data types. JSON-C (Compact) is a strict superset of JSON-B that supports compact representation of repeated data strings with short numeric codes. JSON-D (Data) supports additional binary data types for integer and floating point representations for use in scientific applications where conversion between binary and decimal representations would cause a loss of precision.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="s-2">
<t>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a simple text encoding for the JavaScript Data model that has found wide application beyond its original field of use. In particular JSON has rapidly become a preferred encoding for Web Services.</t>
<t>JSON encoding supports just four fundamental data types (integer, floating point, string and boolean), arrays and objects which consist of a list of tag-value pairs.</t>
<t>Although the JSON encoding is sufficient for many purposes it is not always efficient. In particular there is no efficient representation for blocks of binary data. Use of base64 encoding increases data volume by 33%. This overhead increases exponentially in applications where nested binary encodings are required making use of JSON encoding unsatisfactory in cryptographic applications where nested binary structures are frequently required.</t>
<t>Another source of inefficiency in JSON encoding is the repeated occurrence of object tags. A JSON encoding containing an array of a hundred objects such as {"first":1,"second":2} will contain a hundred occurrences of the string "first" (seven bytes) and a hundred occurrences of the string "second" (eight bytes). Using two byte code sequences in place of strings allows a saving of 11 bytes per object without loss of information, a saving of 50%.</t>
<t>A third objection to the use of JSON encoding is that floating point numbers can only be represented in decimal form and this necessarily involves a loss of precision when converting between binary and decimal representations. While such issues are rarely important in network applications they can be critical in scientific applications. It is not acceptable for saving and restoring a data set to change the result of a calculation.</t>
<section title="Objectives" anchor="s-2_1">
<t>The following were identified as core objectives for a binary JSON encoding:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Low overhead encoding and decoding</t>
<t>Easy to convert existing encoders and decoders to add binary support</t>
<t>Efficient encoding of binary data</t>
<t>Ability to convert from JSON to binary encoding in a streaming mode (i.e. without reading the entire binary data block before beginning encoding.</t>
<t>Lossless encoding of JavaScript data types</t>
<t>The ability to support JSON tag compression and extended data types are considered desirable but not essential for typical network applications.</t>
</list></t>
</list></t>
<t>Three binary encodings are defined:</t>
<t><list style="hanging">
<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="JSON-B (Binary)">Simply encodes JSON data in binary. Only the JavaScript data model is supported (i.e. atomic types are integers, double or string). Integers may be 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits either signed or unsigned. Floating points are IEEE 754 binary64 format [IEEE-754]. Supports chunked encoding for binary and UTF-8 string types.</t>
<t hangText="JSON-C (Compact)">As JSON-B but with support for representing JSON tags in numeric code form (16 bit code space). This is done for both compact encoding and to allow simplification of encoders/decoders in constrained environments. Codes may be defined inline or by reference to a known dictionary of codes referenced via a digest value.</t>
<t hangText="JSON-D (Data)">As JSON-C but with support for representing additional data types without loss of precision. In particular other IEEE 754 floating point formats, both binary and decimal and Intel's 80 bit floating point, plus 128 bit integers and bignum integers.</t>
</list></t>
</list></t>

<section title="Extended JSON Grammar" anchor="s-3">
<t>The JSON-B, JSON-C and JSON-D encodings are all based on the JSON grammar [RFC4627] using the same syntactic structure but different lexical encodings.</t>
<t>JSON-B0 and JSON-C0 replace the JSON lexical encodings for strings and numbers with binary encodings. JSON-B1 and JSON-C1 allow either lexical encoding to be used. Thus any valid JSON encoding is a valid JSON-B1 or JSON-C1 encoding.</t>
<t>The grammar of JSON-B, JSON-C and JSON-D is a superset of the JSON grammar. The following productions are added to the grammar:</t>
<t><list style="hanging">
<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="x-value">Binary encodings for data values. As the binary value encodings are all self delimiting</t>
<t hangText="x-member">An object member where the value is specified as an X-value and thus does not require a value-separator.</t>
<t hangText="b-value">Binary data encodings defined in JSON-B.</t>
<t hangText="b-string">Defined length string encoding defined in JSON-B.</t>
<t hangText="c-def">Tag code definition defined in JSON-C. These may only appear before the beginning of an Object or Array and before any preceding white space.</t>
<t hangText="c-tag">Tag code value defined in JSON-C.</t>
<t hangText="d-value">Additional binary data encodings defined in JSON-D for use in scientific data applications.</t>
</list></t>
</list></t>
<t>The JSON grammar is modified to permit the use of x-value productions in place of ( value value-separator ) :</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="s-8">
<t>A correctly implemented data encoding mechanism should not introduce new security vulnerabilities. However, experience demonstrates that some data encoding approaches are more prone to introduce vulnerabilities when incorrectly implemented than others.</t>
<t>In particular, whenever variable length data formats are used, the possibility of a buffer overrun vulnerability is introduced. While best practice suggests that a coding language with native mechanisms for bounds checking is the best protection against such errors, such approaches are not always followed. While such vulnerabilities are most commonly seen in the design of decoders, it is possible for the same vulnerabilities to be exploited in encoders.</t>
<t>A common source of such errors is the case where nested length encodings are used. For example, a decoder relies on an outermost length encoding that specifies a length on 50 bytes to allocate memory for the entire result and then attempts to copy a string with a declared length of 1000 bytes within the sequence.</t>
<t>The extensions to the JSON encoding described in this document are designed to avoid such errors. Length encodings are only used to define the length of x-value constructions which are always terminal and cannot have nested data entries. </t>
