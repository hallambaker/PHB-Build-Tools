=To Do.

==GetPINKey

This currently uses HMAC256 instead of the authentication provider passed in as a parameter.

==Ticket

Has authentication and encryption methods that aren't derrived from the common algorithms.

Might well be redundant. We have TicketData as well.

==ConvertFromBase64String

Surely redundant.
