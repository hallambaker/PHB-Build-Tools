    // Stub class to be used to create an indexed version of the
    // key store at a later date.

    // This is not currently necessary as reading a simulated 
    // keystore with 100K keys only takes 13 seconds.

    // If the key store gets to 10 million entries, keeping the 
    // entire index in memorey starts to become impractical.
    // In this situation it is better to keep only the index
    // and a cache in-memory and read entries from disk on cache
    // misses.

    // The indexed version of the key store would be produced by
    // a separate process that reads in the keystore and emits the
    // indicies. Such a process can scan the log incrementally, 
    // avoiding the need to keep the entire log in memory at once.

    // If the size of the log became enormous, even the need to 
    // keep the entire index in memory can be avoided. The scanner
    // could compile separate indexes for each value of the first
    // n bits.
