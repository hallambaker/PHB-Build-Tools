        Making Examples</h1>
    <p>
        One of the best ways to document a protocol is to show examples of the protocol 
        in use. But protocol examples that are wrong or outdated can create more 
        confusion than understanding.</p>
    <p>
        Using the tools provided in ProtoGen and Goedel allows us to create protocol 
        examples that are always synchronized to the latest version of the code. To do 
        this we need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A client to create requests.</li>
        <li>A service to create responses.</li>
        <li>A tool to merge the example messages into the documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We have already seen how to create a client and server for the Enquirer service. 
        We could use the same code to generate the protocol messages but this would 
        require the program that creates the message examples to create separate threads 
        for the client and server, pass messages between them over TCP/IP and somehow 
        catch the messages in the wireline format.</p>
    <p>
        The DirectBinding class provides a simpler way to generate sample messages by 
        connecting the client transaction API to the server callbacks directly. This 
        allows us to avoid the unnecessay complication of writting code to handle 
        concurrency to create a few dozen sample messages.</p>
    <p>
        In order to generate the sample messages for the Enquirer service we are going 
        to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create the Enquirer service as before but using the DirectBinding in place of 
            WebServerBinding</li>
        <li>Create the </li>
    </ul>
