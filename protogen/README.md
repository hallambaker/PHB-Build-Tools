ProtoGen

Code generator for Web Services

Status: Generates C# code and documentation for Web Services using JSON coding.

The tool was written as a protocol design tool and is somewhat biased towards that goal. Generating C# rather than C, 
and so on. This will change in the near future as we implement the Omnibroker Protocol.

Planned:
  * Generate code in C, Objective C
  * Support url/form encoding used in certain REST Web Services
  * Support XML / SOAP
  * Generate WSDL
  * Tweaks to improve documentation.
